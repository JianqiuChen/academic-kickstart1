* 1 Introduce data enhancement methods such as mixup,cutout,cutmix to increase the unbiased sample size. 
* 2 Use the method of pix2pix to color the image twice to solve the problem that can not be distinguished due to color differences. 
* 3 Use pseudo-label data, make biased data and adjust depth, control threshold and insertion ratio, and prevent over-fitting of the model. 
* 4 Enhance (TTA) when testing the output results, use label smoothing to reduce over-fitting during training. 
* 5 Analyze the error samples and formulate optimization objectives and feasible schemes.
