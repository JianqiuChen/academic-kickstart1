* 1 The feature expression is further optimized, and the unshared network structure is adopted to extract complementary features. 
* 2 Experiments compare a variety of location methods, and apply them to each stage of feature extraction according to the "personality" of different location methods. 
* 3 Adopt class activation diagram to guide the location of regions of interest. 
* 4 Improve the fusion method and introduce ranking loss to guide the convergence of the model. 
* 5 The accuracy of multiple data sets (stanford car,FGVC-aircraft) is better than that of similar models.
